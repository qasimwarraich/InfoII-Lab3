# Informatics II - 2021 - Lab 3  

## What is this? ü§î
During my exercise sessions for the Informatics II (Algorithms and Data structures) lecture at UZH I often present alternative implementations or solutions for the assigned exercises. These **UNOFFICIAL** solutions exist as examples to show students different implementations with an example they are already familiar with. A number of students requested that I share my code with them, hence the creation of this repository. I will try to do my best to create alternative solutions every week for the students but this will not always be possible. When possible I will upload any of my personal solutions to the exercises here and try my best to comment them and write them in an easy to understand way. 

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important! ‚ö†Ô∏è
**This is not official learning material** and must be treated as such. This repository exists merely as a extra external resource and not something to be considered material related to the lecture at the University. Please study from the official solutions!
